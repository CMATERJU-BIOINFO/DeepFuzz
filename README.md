# DeepFuzz

In this repository, we've implemented the code resulting in the submitted paper "Deep-Fuzz: A synergistic integration of deep learning and
fuzzy water flows for fine-grained nuclei segmentation in digital pathology." in Plos One, by Nirmal Das, Satadal Saha, Mita Nasipuri, Subhadip Basu, Tapabrata Chakraborti. The Deep-Fuzz code repository conssist of two different module: 1) a U-Net based deep learning module  and 2) Qt C++ based fuzz module.
